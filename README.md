#Color My Keyboard
I recently bought an [Ergodox](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/ergodox?s=ergodox)  and didn't know which keycap color to choose from so I created this tool to visualize different keycap color schemes for the+ Ergodox.

##Colors
The colors are the 10 colors currently offered by [Signature Plastics Ergodox Set](http://keyshop.pimpmykeyboard.com/products/full-keysets/dsa-blank-sets-1).
I will probably add more or an option to choose your own color.

##Usage
The page will show an ergodox with randomly chosen keycap colors and will let you choose colors from the bottom of the page. Use the toggle to change between modifier keys and base keys.

##Layout
The keycap and keyboard style is a modified version of this [Codepen](http://codepen.io/dehash/pen/nEJyf). I modified this to create the left side of the Ergodox as well as the thumb cluster. For the right side I copied the same html but rotated it in order to mirror the left side.
