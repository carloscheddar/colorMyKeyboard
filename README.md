#Color My Keyboard
I recently bought an [Ergodox](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/ergodox?s=ergodox)  and didn't know which keycap color to choose from so I created this tool to visualize different keycap color schemes for the Ergodox. [Demo](http://carloscheddar.github.io/colorMyKeyboard/)

##Colors
The 10 colors are the ones currently offered by [Signature Plastics Ergodox Set](http://keyshop.pimpmykeyboard.com/products/full-keysets/dsa-blank-sets-1).
I will probably add more or an option to choose your own color.

##Usage
The page will show an ergodox with randomly chosen keycap colors and will let you choose colors from the bottom of the page. Use the toggle to change between modifier keys and base keys.

##Layout
The keycap and keyboard style is a modified version of this [Codepen](http://codepen.io/dehash/pen/nEJyf). I switched the scheme to use columns instead of rows because of the Ergodox shape. This was used for the left side and the thumbcluster. For the right side I mirrored the left side using css rotate.

##Contributing
If you'd like to add your own colors or more features feel free to create a Pull Request and I'll be sure to merge it as soon as I can.
